CS303 Assignment 2
This program has two different parts. First is the list section. The main menu is as follows:

To start, I'll just add a value:

Once added, I'll add a new value to the front with option 2:

We can then check through options 5 and 6, that both values are there:

I'll then add a value to the back. This will then show up on 6 as being the last value in the list:

Next I'll pop the first value:

Now can confirm the first value is no longer 45:

Next I'll pop the back value, 567876, and confirm it is no longer there:

We know that 32 is the only value left, so next we'll search for it:

If I search for something else entirely, I will get 1 as there is one item:

Finally for the next part there are two options: Making a professional or non professional employee. We'll start with a professional:

Next a non professional employee:
